# Tool-for-amazfit-pace-and-stratos
This is a tool i made a long time ago is uncomplited and it has some bugs but it works, you need to have installed adb and fastboot to make it work it.
I made this program like 3 yrs ago ( I was 14 at that age ), it was the first program i ever made.
Its a bit outdate and its discontinued and its transalted to english (when i first made it it was in Spanish but i after transalted it to english) and at that time i wasent really good at english so if there is any gramma mistakes im sorry.
And also in the way i made the program you can't change the direcory of instalation because when i made it at that time it woulnt work if you did not install it the the C directory 
And yes you are free to do whatever you want with this program
