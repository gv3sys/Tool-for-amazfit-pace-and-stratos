# Tool-for-amazfit-pace-and-stratos
This is a tool i made a long time ago is uncomplited and it has some bugs but it works, you need to have installed adb and fastboot to make it work it.
I made this program like 3 yrs ago ( I was 14 at that age ), it was the first program i ever made.

Its a bit outdate and its discontinued and its transalted to english (when i first made it it was in Spanish but i after transalted it to english) and at that time i wasent really good at english so if there is any gramma mistakes im sorry.
And also in the way i made the program you can't change the direcory of instalation because when i made it at that time it woulnt work if you did not install it the the C directory 

And yes you are free to do whatever you want with this program



And for the people how are interested in some back story welp here you have it: 

I started programing at the age of 12 with some lego robots it was really basic things and we code it with an iPad, the next year i decided i wanted to do something cool so i searched up in the internet how to make a menu with a batch file and welp i copy pasted the first thing that it show up as an exaple.

Some time later for that xmas I got my smartwatch, an amazfit pace wich i still use now a days, and thanks to the boost of xda Developers and my previus experiences couding I decided to made that menu so i could automatice the work, and well cuz of school i had to leave that porject and now i publish it hear in case someone is interested on it or want to contiune it 

Update: I migh continu it in a future
